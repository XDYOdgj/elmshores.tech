	var commentsList = [{"user":"irv1n88","content":"I am one of those people that will wash clothes and if they come out too wrinkly they are hidden away in my closet....essentially forever.I remembered how fast and easy it was to get wrinkles out of clothes using a steamer when I worked in retail as a teenager and wondered if a smaller home model would be as effective. Well...it certainly is.I LOVE this steamer!The first day I got it I excitedly pulled it out, filled it with water, and began testing it on my newly washed clothes.It was so fast and easy that I began pulling those clothes out of my closet that were so wrinkled that taking an iron to them seemed hopeless and in less than a minute each article was complete.The basics: light materials (rayon, silk, cotton) are perfect for a steamer.The wrinkles come out very quickly and if a few drops get on the item when you initially turn the steamer on the steam makes the water evaporate almost immediately.The steamer also works really well on thick fabrics such as sweaters; although it's not as quick as rayon it's still very quick...probably still well under a minute.Positive: very fast, clean, and easy; the pole that you hang your clothing from is very convenient; the pole can be collapsed for easy storage; great for odd items like ruffled collars on women's shirts that are more difficult to iron; can also be used on curtains although an extension would be needed because the cord can only extend about 6'.Negative: if you want a crease in your pants than you can't use a steamer.This is the best money I spent since I got my first Tivo over 10 years ago.I am going to buy one for everyone I know.Whether you see the iron as a nuisance like I did or not the steamer is still an excellent purchase and a really great price for the overall value.","purchase_model":"Style:  SF-407 Style: SF-407  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2011-01-10 20:42:02"},{"user":"Ron","content":"Had this unit for a couple of months now and use it a couple of times per week.Over all I am pleased with it.While it will not replace an iron for pressing purposes it does do a good job at steaming wrinkles from most fabrics.Which is convenient considering that is what it is suppose to do, heh.**Good points**1) The water heats up to steam level quickly.I rarely wait more than 60 seconds, or so, for steam build up.2) The steam is a steady adequate flow once going.It rarely spurts out hot water (until other home steamers I've tried).3) Once turned off the water cools down relatively quickly and thus the steam flow from the \"sitting\" unit stops shortly after power off.4) The base is light weight but heavy enough that my clothes don't cause it to tip when they are hanging from the fully extended pole.Unless I do something stupid like hang way too many clothes off the pole for some reason (did that once, don't know why, hah).5) I have yet to see any significant mineral build up.Though arguably I only use the steamer for a few minutes 2-3 times a week.**General points (not bad but not spectacular either)**1) The hose, while perfectly long enough for articles hanging from the extended pole, will not reach the top of hanging high level drapes.As this is a floor model and not designed to be lifted that makes steaming said drapes difficult without first taking them down.Nothing horrible, just thought the hose length should be noted.2) This item works well for a home steamer.The \"home\" moniker should be noted, as it does not produce powerful industrial steam flow.And as such will not replace an iron for very thick/stubborn fabrics (even when using the included backing pad).**Bad points**1) nothing negative has come up yet.Overall, I have been very pleased with this home steamer and found it to be an excellent purchase.It is a well priced (maybe even cheap) unit that still produces good results with no noted negatives so far.","purchase_model":"Style:  SF-407 Style: SF-407  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2011-04-29 20:42:02"},{"user":"Yona Rappaport","content":"I bought this steamer because I love thrift store shopping. Anyone who's been to a thrift store may already know that you can expect a strange odor from anything and everything you bring home. Since I \"upcycle\" most of the things I buy, I wanted to kill two birds with one stone; eliminate odors as well as pressing the fabric for easy deconstruction.My steamer came about a month ago and I've used it a handful of times for about 40 min to an hour every time. I am very pleased with the construction, all of the pieces and parts look well made and are fully functional. The foam pad was squished pretty badly in the box but it popped back to life in about 5 days. I must admit, I the steam definitely helps the thrift store stank but does not remove it completely, it almost seems to go away and then once the garment is cool again it comes back very slightly.I did have concerns before making my purchase, one review said that the steamer squirts hot water randomly and could wet the garment or burn the operator. Within about 10 minutes of using the steamer I figured out what happens. With the buildup of steam and condensation coating the rubber tube after using the steamer for a few minutes, this water will travel to the lowest point and sit there. The continuous pressure from the steam still being made by the machine will push the hot water out the hose with enough buildup. To remedy the situation, one just needs to make the hose straight again every few minutes by lifting the steam head high up, allowing the water buildup to drop back down into the tank. The steamer makes a noise before it shoots water out so it's easy to anticipate. SCIENCE.As far as taking wrinkles out of fabric, it works great. I would recommend this for anyone who has regular household needs. I really only need to use it about twice a week for maybe an hour. Although it would work for a shop or for someone with higher volume of steaming to do, the item was clearly designed for clothing, the range of motion allowed by the hose and extension cordare not extensive- you really can't hang something longer than the extendo-holdy pole.Overall, a great product, the only thing I might change about it is weighting the base more because as you steam, your tank becomes lighter and lighter and very thick heavy fabrics may not be held up by it anymore.","purchase_model":"Style:  SF-407 Style: SF-407  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-04-24 20:42:02"},{"user":"justbecause","content":"I wish I'd known how awesome steam cleaners were before.Would've saved me so much time, effort, and exposure to chemicals.I'd originally bought it to kill dust mites on my mattress, but I had read that steam cleaners were really good for household cleaning.So I gave it a shot.Normally on my tub I'll use a Magic Eraser or a spray tile and tub cleaner.Even when the mold is visibly wiped off, I still smell mold unless I use Soft Scrub (bleach-based cleaner).When I used this steam cleaner on the tile and tub, the buildup loosened and wiped off easily with a soft microfiber sponge.I was skeptical that it could be anywhere near as effective as bleach, so I was pretty shocked when my tub didn't smell at all like mold.It still takes maybe twice the time of using Soft Scrub, since it's a relatively small steam cleaner without fancy attachments, but it's worth it.No chemicals!(And I won't accidentally bleach my clothes!)My kitchen is small and I cook a lot, so it's worth getting on my hands and knees to clean the floor.Sometimes I'm lazy and use multipurpose spray cleaner; other times I'll use dish soap and water.The steam cleaner worked better than even soap and water.The buildup that tends to get stuck in crevices gets soft enough that the sponge molds into any hard-to-reach places and wipes it out.Even without soap, grease came off completely.That floor has NEVER been this clean.Caught myself cleaning things that were already reasonably clean, just to see what else it would remove.It's a lifesaver for baseboards.If you're not someone who cleans them religiously, you know how difficult it is to remove that caked-on dust.With the steam cleaner, it wipes right off.I would caution anyone who uses it on painted surfaces (walls, for example) not to let the surface steam too long, or the paint will start to loosen.The handle is designed so that you'd have to really not be paying attention to burn yourself.If the hose kinks, the steam does stop coming out.If you don't see steam coming out, more than likely it's not having any effect.But propping the handle back on the stand while it's extended and waiting a little while will cause it to start steaming again.(It really does only take 40 seconds to start steaming, even at first.)My one little gripe is that the hose isn't quite long enough to get the top of the tile in my bathtub.(First world problems.)...Haven't tried using it to get wrinkles out of clothes yet, but I will, since I hate ironing.It looks as if there are other steam cleaners on the market that'll have more pressure, higher temperatures, are adjustible, probably cover more surface area, and have attachments that will allow you to scrub as you go...even pieces that go down your drains to kill bacteria and mold.But they're expensive - probably from $400 to $2,000.This is easily the best $50 I've ever spent.It just does so much.","purchase_model":"Style:  SF-407 Style: SF-407  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2012-06-18 20:42:02"},{"user":"Noof Hassan","content":"To begin with I have been having this steamer for almost a month now and so far so goodalso I am not someone who like to wright reviews but this steamer really made my life much easier.The first paragraph is just an introduction to show which kind of customer I am and what are my needs because that what willdetermine whither it is what you are looking for or you have different needs than what my experience is all aboutbut if you don't feel like reading about me just go to the second paragraphor actually the third since this is kind of the second :)I am a university student who hate ironing her clothes every morning and when I do, it takes me around 10 - 15 min(when you have just wake up, u go slow ), so I complained to my mom and she advicesd me to buy a steamer and she said any brand will do the work for you, but this didn't convince me,so I did my own research to find one that is affordable for a student + doing a good job and kind of replace the iron(I didn't expect it to replace the iron %100). Finally, I end up buying this one from amazon(if you are in Canada and live in an apartment just like me DON'T buy it from amazon I had a bad experience with the shipping company UPSit wont be delivered to your door )However, I am not reviewing amazon shipping hereSo back to my experience with this lovely steamer when I first got it, it was easy to install and operateI test it immediately in one of my longest scarves which usually gives me hard time to iron , but this time WOW it was straight in less than a minute or maybe even in just 10 seconds. Also the steamer heated up in a few secondsthe next day before school I tried it on my usual clotha shirt + jeans + a scarfand it did a greet job on all of them and I didn't have to use the iron, so it did replace it for me:)since that day I love steaming my cloth every morningactually sometime when I have a long break between classes, I go back to my apartment which is on campus just to steam my cloths againI told you I love itand it has a peace of foamnot sure if it really foamthat u use it to protect your hands when u steam; I sometime just use it under my shirt and steam while I am wearing it, but I don't guarantee any one safetyLast thing I want to mention I have also used it in my bed sheets, which I have never ever thought about ironing it before, and it did a good jobEdited on 25/10/20132 years later !this steamer still working for me n i can say it worth every pennythough i find that it doesn't steam as fast as when i first got it ( now i just turn it onn finish something n then come back to use it )but it stills do its job n its still much faster for me to use it than using my regular iron ( n ya i havent used it for 2 years if thats say anything other than me being lazy)","purchase_model":"Style:  SF-407 Style: SF-407  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2011-10-14 20:42:02"},{"user":"Chon (the Grill Master) Salinas","content":"Super easy to use.

After using my SteamFast 1500-Watt Fabric steamer for the first time, all I can say is \"Why did I ever use those cheap-o $30 Conair products?\"My wife and I use fabric steamers every day. We hate ironing. We can't stand bringing out the board, setting it up and then painstakingly going over every square inch of fabric it and pressing down just right to get the wrinkles out. Four years ago we purchased a Conair GS60 (Similar to today's model, but all gray) and felt elated not to have to bring out the board and iron ever again. After two years the first steamer died, so we replaced it with an exact model from the local big box store. Eventually that model died as well and while deciding what to do, I checked out amazon because I know the ratings here are made by real people. Looking over fabric steamers this SteamFast model stood out because of its less than $100 price point and the +200 reviews averaging 4 stars. The updated Conair model we were using was rated at 3.5, but I was interested because this model claims steam in less than a minute. The Conair model, brand new, would take approx 5-7 minutes before you'd have usable steam.My first experience with the SteamFast was this morning. I followed the easy to assemble instructions (Insert hanger rod into slot, screw on hose connection, fill with water and turn on). I was going to time it to see how long it would take before I could steam my clothes for work and after finding my watch in the dark, I returned to the steamer to find it pumping out beautiful jets of steam. The wait was maybe 30 seconds. I remember people discussing that speed and I wasn't sure I believed them, but wow, it's true! I was able to steam my pants and the shirt for work in just a few minutes and was done before my old model would have even started producing steam!Trust me, it's worth it. Get it. If you hate ironing, if you want to get a steamer to replace an old one, this is the choice for you.The construction is good quality. The housing is a durable plastic. The hanger rod is made of aluminum and extend through 3 sections to get to a height of approximately 5 feet. The hose has a metal spring wrapped around it at the base to prevent pinches in the line, which is a great feature. Hose connection/coat hanger attachment is durable plastic and the coat hanger can accommodate both the metal and plastic loops of today's modern coat hangers. The power cord is approximately 5 feet long with a 3 pronged outlet connection--I do with the cord was a bit longer so I could plug it into a different outlet, but it's not that big of a complaint. The instructions are to use de-mineralized water to avoid that mineral build up that steamers are used to, so using a filtered pitcher to fill the water container is a good idea to prolong the times between filling it up with vinegar to clean out mineral buildup. The instructions are clear and easy to follow.I will be recommending this model to my friends. 5 stars!","purchase_model":"Style:  SF-407 Style: SF-407  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2011-03-01 20:42:02"},{"user":"Amazon Customer","content":"Very helpful to clean your dressy clothes when it\u2019s necessary picks up the dust off your clothes","purchase_model":"Style:  SF-520 Style: SF-520  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-13 20:42:02"},{"user":"Matt/Julie Spence","content":"Works great good quality","purchase_model":"Style:  SF-520 Style: SF-520  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-12-14 20:42:02"}];
